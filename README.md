# [Portfolio](https://treestory.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and then run `npm install` to install all dependencies and then `npm run dev` to load the local server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## New features

Although this portfolio already achieved the main objectives I had in mind, I will still add other features like:

- [ ] Add a category filter to the projects section
- [ ] Add backend to automate the 2min task of manually adding a project. (right now there's an array with objects, each one being a different project).
